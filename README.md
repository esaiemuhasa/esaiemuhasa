## About Me

I am a **Civil Engineer in Computer Science** and a **software engineer** with strong experience in designing and building reliable and scalable applications.

I mainly work with **Java**, **PHP**, **JavaScript**, and **TypeScript**, and I have solid experience with modern frameworks such as **Spring**, **Symfony**, **React**, and **Next.js**.  
On the backend side, I actively use **Java EE / Jakarta EE** and **RESTful API architectures**.

I also have experience developing:
- Desktop applications (Java Swing / JavaFX)
- Web applications (React, Symfony, JEE)
- API-driven systems

For databases, I work with:
- **PostgreSQL**
- **MariaDB**
- **SQLite** and **H2** (portable and embedded use cases)

I am particularly interested in:
- **Software architecture**
- **Distributed systems**
- **Data modeling**
- **System interoperability (API, WebSocket, streaming)**
- **Automation & deployment workflows**
